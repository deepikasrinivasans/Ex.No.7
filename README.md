# Ex. No. 7: Dynamic Schedule Reorganization with AI

## Name: Deepika S
## Register No: 212223240068

# Aim
To develop and implement a prompt-based application using a large language model (LLM) to dynamically reorganize a user's daily schedule in response to unexpected task cancellations.

# AI Tools Required
ChatGPT or any other large language model (LLM) like Google Gemini.

# Explanation
This experiment moves beyond creating a general-purpose assistant to a targeted application focused on real-time problem-solving. The core of this exercise is to demonstrate the power of contextual prompt engineering. By providing the AI with a structured prompt that includes the current schedule, the canceled tasks, and a clear objective (optimizing time), we enable it to act as a strategic productivity tool.

# The prompt will ask the AI to:

Analyze the newly available time slots.

Reorganize the remaining tasks logically.

Suggest new priorities or opportunities for rest.

This process highlights how a well-crafted prompt can transform a versatile LLM into a specialized, highly effective tool for managing daily life. To better visualize the concept, imagine an AI assistant actively reviewing your calendar:

# Prompt
"I have a daily schedule with the following tasks and their estimated times:

...and so on.

# The following tasks have just been unexpectedly canceled:

[Canceled Task A]

[Canceled Task B]

Please review my remaining agenda and instantly reorganize my schedule to optimize my time. Based on the new availability, recommend new priorities, such as moving a low-priority task earlier, or suggest opportunities for rest and breaks. The output should be a revised, prioritized schedule."

# Procedure
Define the Scenario: Start with a realistic, busy day to make the exercise practical. For example, a student's schedule with classes, study sessions, and social plans. This initial state is crucial for the AI to understand the context.

Construct the Prompt: Write a clear, structured prompt based on the template above. Replace the placeholders with a specific, hypothetical agenda and a list of two or more canceled tasks.

Simulate Interaction: Input the complete prompt into your chosen AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT).

Analyze the Output: Evaluate the AI's response. Check if it successfully reorganizes the schedule, fills the empty time slots, and provides logical suggestions for new priorities or rest.

Refine the Prompt (Optional): If the initial output isn't perfect, refine the prompt. Try adding more constraints, like "prioritize tasks with the earliest deadlines" or "group similar tasks together," to see how the AI's response changes.

# Expected Output
The AI's response should be a new, logical schedule that takes the cancellations into account. It should demonstrate an understanding of the time gaps and offer a solution that is both practical and beneficial to the user.

# Example Response by LLM:

### Revised Schedule

8:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Focus Time for Project Report (High Priority)

11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Rest and Breaks (Wellness Tip: Use this time to stretch or take a short walk.)

12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch

1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Research for New Proposal

3:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Administrative Tasks (Re-prioritized from 4:00 PM to fill the open slot)

4:00 PM - 5:00 PM: Call with Mom (Re-prioritized from 3:00 PM)

5:00 PM - 6:00 PM: Final Project Review (High Priority)

# Recommendations:

You now have a solid block of uninterrupted time in the morning for your high-priority report.

The hour between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM can be used for a personal break to recharge.

# Roadmap: Prompt-Driven Dynamic Scheduling:
This roadmap outlines the conceptual steps involved in building and utilizing a prompt-driven dynamic scheduling application using an LLM.

# Result
This lab exercise successfully demonstrated how to use a large language model for a sophisticated, real-time problem-solving task. Students learned to craft precise prompts that leverage an AI's analytical capabilities to handle dynamic, real-world scenarios. The experiment highlighted the importance of prompt engineering in transforming a general-purpose AI into a powerful, personalized tool for productivity and efficiency.
